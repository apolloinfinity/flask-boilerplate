## Install and create a virtual enviroment.
To install a virtual enviroment
**Pip**: 
...pip install virtualenv
**Creating the enviroment**
...virtualenv venv

## Activate the virtual enviroment
There are two ways to get the app running. On Linux/Mac it's pretty straighfoward because of bash.
On Windows, it depends on how you have your enviroment set up. I use VSCode with Git Bash. I have used Powershell and the command prompt to run Flask apps before so I will show you how do it.
